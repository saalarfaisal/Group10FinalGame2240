Our project highlights the creation of an interactive game app that has applicable functionality, and usage.

The functionality of this is game is of simplicity. Ideally, the user is to pop all the balloons on the screen without missing. Each balloon popped results in a point, and each balloon missed results in a life (pin) that is lost. There are three lives in the game, and each level consists of twelve balloons. Each time a player finishes the level, he moves to the next. There are an infinite number of levels, and in each level the speed of the balloons increases by a factor of 500 milliseconds. As the player continues to pop the balloons their score is displayed on the bottom right panel. Once the player loses all three lives, a pop up of “game over” appears and then if the player has set a new high score record, it is displayed, and then the game ends. The game can also be stopped by clicking on stop game on the left bottom panel.

The usage of this game is for everyone, but primarily targeting youths of age 8-15 years old. It consists of a good gameplay that one can play when waiting somewhere or when they are bored. It is very addictive as the level of difficulty increases on each level and this invites competition as friends could compete on who can get the highest score and last the longest. In addition, the game helps improve hand-eye coordination as the speed and the reaction to the balloons increase.
